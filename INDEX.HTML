               <div> <p> By 2050, projections show that one in eight adults across the globe—approximately 853 million people—will be living with diabetes. 
               Harvard researchers continue to pursue insights into prevention, treatment, and even a cure for the widespread disease. </p></div>

                  he and his colleagues made a series of discoveries that laid the groundwork for a new treatment to restore insulin production in patients with type 1 diabetes.</hp></div>

                   <p>Students from the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences developed a storage container capable of maintaining,
                       monitoring, and displaying its interior temperature to ensure drugs like insulin are kept at the right temperature as they’re delivered to hospitals, pharmacies,
                        and at-home users.</p>

          <h1>Diabetes dictionary</h1>
                <p>Diabetes is a condition of abnormally high levels of glucose in the blood due to the body is not 
                 making enough insulin or not properly using the insulin it makes.</p>

                   <img src="sanguineo.jpg" width="350px" height="200px">

          <h2>Glucose</h2>
                  <p>A single simple sugar used by human cells. The body has intricate mechanisms
                  in place to make sure glucose levels in the blood don’t go too low or soar too high.</p>
           
                   <img src="insulina-que-es-como-funciona.jpeg" width="350px" height="200px">

           <h2>Insulin</h2>
                  <p>A hormone produced by the pancreas that shuttles glucose out of the bloodstream 
                  and into cells to be used for energy. If the pancreas is unable to make insulin, 
                   glucose levels may rise dangerously.</p>
        
               <img src="glucometro.jpg" > 

           <h2>Type 1 diabetes</h2>
                 <p>An autoimmune condition in which immune cells attack and permanently
                  disable the insulin-making cells in the pancreas. Formerly called juvenile-onset diabetes,
                 it was once believed that only children developed this form of diabetes.</p>

                <img src="embarazo.jpg">

           <h2>Gestational diabetes</h2>
                <p>A condition of high blood glucose levels during the second trimester of pregnancy usually 
                   occurring around the 24th week. Up to 25% of pregnant women develop gestational diabetes.</p>

                  <img src="g y f.jpg" >

           <h2>Prediabetes</h2>
                 <p>An early warning sign that exhibits itself through moderately elevated blood sugar levels.
                   Prediabetes almost always precedes a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.</p>
                   
                      <img src="iiiiiii.jpg" >

          <h2>Type 2 diabetes</h2>
                <p>The most common form of diabetes. When the body makes more and more insulin to help move glucose 
                out of the blood, it can eventually exhaust the insulin-producing cells until they burn out.</p>

         <h1>Researching the risks</h1>
               <p>Harvard experts have been exploring the risks associated with developing diabetes,
               as well as factors that may impact the quality of life of diabetics.</p>

                         <p>Prolonged sitting has been linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as heart disease and stroke. Research shows that getting regular
                        exercise can help fend off diabetes, even in people with a genetic propensity for the disease. Those with prediabetes can significantly reduce their risk of progressing to diabetes by engaging in
                        at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. And after an active day, getting consistent sleep could also help stave off type 2 diabetes. Investigators at Brigham and Women’s Hospital found that those with the 
                        most irregular sleep patterns had a 34% higher chance of developing diabetes.</p>

                           . And on the dessert front: choosing dark chocolate over milk chocolate may be associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
